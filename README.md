Hi, I'am Duy - an ex-BIM Engineer (Buiding Information Modeling - Construction Engineer) at VINCI Group in France. I'm always eager to learn new things and solve problems. In my BIM engineering job, I have had the chance to use VBA and C# to develop the applications for my company and I have found my real passion for programming. So, I decide to move on and move in the IT development to follow my dream.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, TypeScript, Microservices, Docker, Design Pattern
